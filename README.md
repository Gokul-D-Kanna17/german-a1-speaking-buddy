# German A1 Speaking Buddy

**AI-powered German speaking assistant for beginners**, designed to help international learners build confidence and fluency for the Goethe/TELC A1 exam, and beyond. More than just a study tool, this project is a stepping stone towards an **adaptive AI language companion** that grows with the learner.

## Project Overview

Learning to speak a new language is hard, especially for beginners. Speaking requires practice, a partner, and instant feedback, which is often hard to find.  
**German A1 Speaking Buddy** solves this by simulating the A1 exam’s three speaking parts using:

- Interactive **speech recognition**
- **Text-to-speech prompts**
- **Instant translation**  
This allows learners to practice anytime, anywhere, building confidence and speaking skills effectively.
